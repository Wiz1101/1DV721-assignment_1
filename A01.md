Take a copy of the example program `sample/bash/cli.bash` and extend it.

Add a command that does the following.

1. Present a daily quote and print it out nicely.
1. Use a local command that prints out the quote. You need to find a proper command for this that you can install.

Add another command that does the following.

1. Use the online quote service at https://quotes.rest/ to do get a daily quote.
    * You can opt to use another service that is out there, for example "Drink database JSON API" or similar. The basics is about making a request and parsing the reponse.
1. Print it out in a easy to read manner.

Do not forget to add the helptext of the new commands.

In the report, discuss the following questions.

1. Reflect on the cli code and compare it to other programming languages you have learnt. Talk about the similarity/differences and what is good/bad.
